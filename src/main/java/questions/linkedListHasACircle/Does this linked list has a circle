 **You have a singly-linked list and want to check if it contains a cycle.**

A singly-linked list is built with nodes, where each `node` has:

- `node.next`—the next node in the list.
- `node.value`—the data held in the node. For example, if our linked list stores people in line at the movies, `node.value` might be the person's name.

For example:

`public class LinkedListNode {

    public int value;
    public LinkedListNode next;

    public LinkedListNode(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
}`

A **cycle** occurs when a node’s `next` points _back to a previous node in the list_. The linked list is no longer linear with a beginning and end—instead, it cycles through a loop of nodes.

**Write a method `containsCycle` that takes the first node in a singly-linked list and returns a boolean indicating whether the list contains a cycle.**




# Gotchas

Careful—a cycle can occur in the _middle_ of a list, or it can simply mean the last node links back to the first node. Does your method work for both?

We can do this in O(n) time and O(1) space!


# Breakdown

Because a cycle could result from the last node linking to the first node, we might need to look at every node before we even see the start of our cycle again. So it seems like we can’t do better than O(n) runtime.

How can we track the nodes we’ve already seen?

**Using a hash set, we could store all the nodes we’ve seen so far**. The algorithm is simple:

1. If the current node is already in our hash set, we have a cycle. Return `true`.
2. If the current node is `null` we've hit the end of the list. Return `false`.
3. Else throw the current node in our hash set and keep going.

What are the time and space costs of this approach? Can we do better?

Our runtime is O(n), the best we can do. But our space cost is also O(n). Can we get our space cost down to O(1) by storing a _constant_ number of nodes?

Think about a _looping_ list and a _linear_ list. What happens when you traverse one versus the other?

A linear list has an _end_—a node that doesn’t have a `next` node. But a looped list will run forever. We know we don’t have a loop if we ever reach an end node, but how can we tell if we’ve run into a loop?

We can’t just run our method for a really long time, because we’d never really know with certainty if we were in a loop or just a really long list.

Imagine that you're running on a long, mountainous running trail that happens to be a loop. What are some ways you can tell you're running in a loop?

One way is to **look for landmarks**. You could remember one specific point, and if you pass that point again, you know you’re running in a loop. Can we use that principle here?

**Well, our cycle can occur _after_ a non-cyclical "head" section in the beginning of our linked list**. So we'd need to make sure we chose a "landmark" node that is in the cyclical "tail" and not in the non-cyclical "head." That seems impossible unless we _already know_ whether or not there's a cycle...

Think back to the running trail. Besides landmarks, what are some other ways you could tell you’re running in a loop? What if you had **another runner**? (Remember, it’s a _singly_-linked list, so no running backwards!)

A tempting approach could be to have the other runner stop and act as a "landmark," and see if you pass her again. But we still have the problem of making sure our "landmark" is in the loop and not in the non-looping beginning of the trail.

**What if our "landmark" runner moves continuously but _slowly_?**

If we sprint _quickly_ down the trail and the landmark runner jogs _slowly_, we will eventually "lap" (catch up to) the landmark runner!

But what if there isn't a loop?

Then we (the faster runner) will simply hit the end of the trail (or linked list).

So let's make two variables, `slowRunner` and `fastRunner`. We’ll start both on the first node, and every time `slowRunner` advances one node, we’ll have `fastRunner` advance _two_ nodes.

If `fastRunner` catches up with `slowRunner`, we know we have a loop. If not, eventually `fastRunner` will hit the end of the linked list and we'll know we _don't_ have a loop.

This is a complete solution! Can you code it up?

Make sure the method eventually terminates in all cases!


# Solution

We keep two pointers to nodes (we'll call these “runners”), both starting at the first node. Every time `slowRunner` moves one node ahead, `fastRunner` moves _two_ nodes ahead.

If the linked list has a cycle, `fastRunner` will "lap" (catch up with) `slowRunner`, and they will momentarily equal each other.

If the list does not have a cycle, `fastRunner` will reach the end.

`public static boolean containsCycle(LinkedListNode firstNode) {

    // start both runners at the beginning
    LinkedListNode slowRunner = firstNode;
    LinkedListNode fastRunner = firstNode;

    // until we hit the end of the list
    while (fastRunner != null && fastRunner.next != null) {
        slowRunner = slowRunner.next;
        fastRunner = fastRunner.next.next;

        // case: fastRunner is about to "lap" slowRunner
        if (fastRunner == slowRunner) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    // case: fastRunner hit the end of the list
    return false;
}`


# Complexity

O(n) time and O(1) space.

The runtime analysis is a little tricky. The worst case is when we _do_ have a cycle, so we don't return until `fastRunner` equals `slowRunner`. But how long will that take?

First, we notice that when both runners are circling around the cycle **`fastRunner` can never skip over `slowRunner`**. Why is this true?

Suppose `fastRunner` _had just_ skipped over `slowRunner`. `fastRunner` would only be 1 node ahead of `slowRunner`, since their speeds differ by only 1. So we would have something like this:

`[] -> [s] -> [f]`

What would the step right _before_ this "skipping step" look like? `fastRunner` would be 2 nodes back, and `slowRunner` would be 1 node back. But wait, that means they would be at _the same node_! So `fastRunner` _didn't_ skip over `slowRunner`! (This is a proof by contradiction.)

Since `fastRunner` can't skip over `slowRunner`, _at most_ `slowRunner` will run around the cycle once and `fastRunner` will run around twice. This gives us a runtime of O(n).

For space, we store two variables no matter how long the linked list is, which gives us a space cost of O(1).


# Bonus

1. How would you detect the _first node_ in the cycle? Define the first node of the cycle as the one closest to the head of the list.
2. Would the program always work if the fast runner moves _three_ steps every time the slow runner moves one step?
3. What if instead of a simple linked list, you had a structure where each node could have several "`next`" nodes? This data structure is called a "directed graph." How would you test if your directed graph had a cycle?
