in JobWorker1, the sleep() method can be interrupted.

in JobWorker2, the Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted() is used to check the interruption, actually, you can define any flag that reflect interrupt.

in JobWorker3, the Thread.currentThread().interrupt() is used to work with Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted() to check flag.

As you can see, the interrupt for thread is only useful when sleep() happens.
