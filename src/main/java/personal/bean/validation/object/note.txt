1. in pom.xml, we need:
	hibernate-validator
	javax.el-api
	javax.el
	
2. validator.validate(), return Set<constraintviolation>

3. @Valid has the function of Cascade.

4. groups define validation group, if it is not defined in the annotation, it belong to default group.
	and this group is validate again the validator.validate(object)
	
5. @GroupSequence can combine all group together, but it will finish if previous group validation fails.

6. to validate all, just add all groups to validator.validate(object, group1, group2, ...)

7. toggle comment on @ConvertGroup to see the result.
