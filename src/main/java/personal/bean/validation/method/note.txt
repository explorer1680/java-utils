1. to validate the method, we should use ExecutableValidator executableValidator from validator

2. when validate method, we can use the @Valid to cascade to object validation.

3. please note, the method validation not set the value, not really call the method.
the 'user1' is still null with setName: "Name1"

4. Spring Validation provides an integration with Hibernate Validator.
to use spring to validate constructor, use: 
MethodValidationPostProcessor + @Validated (normal method not needed)

5. If we are using Spring Boot, the container will register a MethodValidationPostProcessor bean for us as long as hibernate-validator is in the classpath.
